            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>
            Currently, I am contributing to the <a href="https://www.sergroup.com/en/" target="_blank">SER Group</a> as an IT Consultant, where I automate customer-specific workflows in a document management system.
            Additionally, I take an active role in the Community of Practice "Standardization of Development", where I lead a working group focused on cloud technologies. I also aid in integrating GitLab into our daily workflow and also aim to establish best programming practices within our department.
            </p>
            <p>
            In my previous role at <a href="https://7p-solutions-consulting.com/en/" target="_blank">7P Solutions & Consulting</a>, I played a pivotal role in developing an innovative, cloud-based platform for streamlined freelance management. Working in a full-stack position, I leveraged my skills to create an efficient and user-friendly solution that enhanced the overall management and coordination of freelancers.
            </p>
            <p>
            My academic years were enriched by invaluable collaborations with the respected Chair for Software Engineering <a href="https://www.se-rwth.de/" target="_blank">I3</a> and the clinic for <a href="https://www.ukaachen.de/en/clinics-institutes/klinik-fuer-nuklearmedizin/" target="_blank">nuclear medicine</a> at Uniklinikum Aachen. This cross-functional experience culminated in my bachelor's thesis, contributing significantly to my foundational knowledge in software development. Additionally, my tenure as a student assistant at the chair of Industrialized Production enabled me to contribute to software-related projects, enhancing my practical experience and fostering team collaboration.

            <h2>Academic Background</h2>
            <p>
                I pursued my undergraduate studies at RWTH Aachen, where I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Economics. This multidisciplinary approach allowed me to develop a well-rounded skill set, combining technical expertise with a solid understanding of economic principles.
                During my time at RWTH Aachen, I immersed myself in the rigorous curriculum of the Computer Science program, gaining in-depth knowledge of various programming languages, algorithms, and software engineering concepts. The comprehensive coursework provided me with a strong foundation in computer science principles and equipped me with the necessary tools to tackle complex technological challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my coursework, I had the privilege of serving as a tutor for the course <i>Datacommunication and Security</i> at the chair for <a href="https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/home" target="_blank">Communication and Distributed Systems</a>. This role involved assisting students with understanding complex concepts, facilitating discussions, and providing guidance on practical assignments. It was a rewarding experience that honed my communication and leadership skills while deepening my knowledge of data communication and security protocols.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote my bachelor's thesis at the chair of Software Engineering in collaboration with the Uniklinikum Aachen with the topic <i>Development of a Domain-Specific Language for Controlling
                a Syringe Pump of a Pharmaceutical Synthesis Plant</i>.
